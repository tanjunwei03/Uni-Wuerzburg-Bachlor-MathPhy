\begin{Problem}
	Show that the Ginzburg-Landau free energy of a domain wall can be written as
	\[
	\Delta F = \frac{u}{4} \int dx \left[ \psi_0^4 - \psi^4(x) \right],
	\]
	where $A = L^{d-1}$ is the area of the domain wall. Using this result, show that the surface tension $\sigma = \Delta F / A$ is given by
	\[
	\sigma = \frac{\sqrt{8}}{3} \xi u \psi_0^4,
	\]
	with $\xi$ the correlation length. To get the final result, you will need to recall the functional form of the soliton, i.e., the solution to the Ginzburg-Landau equation through the domain wall.
\end{Problem}
\begin{proof}
	Landau theory consists of expanding the free energy as a function of the order parameter near to the phase transition, when the free energy is small:
	\[
	F_L(\psi) = \int\frac{r}{2}\psi^2 + \frac{u}{4}\psi^4-h\psi\dd{V}
	,\] 
	where $h$ describes a conjugate field such as a magnetic field. To describe the possible effects of a spatially varying order parameter, we include a gradient term
	\[
	F_{GL}(\psi) = \int \frac{s}{2}(\grad{\psi})^2 + \frac{r}{2}\psi^2+\frac{u}{4}\psi^4 -h\psi \dd{V}
	.\] 
We seek solutions, i.e. order parameter fields that minimise the Ginzburg-Landau functional. This is done by functional differentiation to obtain
\begin{align*}
	\var{F_{GL}(\psi)} &= \int s(\grad{\psi})\cdot \grad{\delta\psi} + r\psi\delta\psi + u\psi^3 \delta\psi - h\delta\psi \dd{V}\\
	&=\int s\div{(\delta{\psi}\grad{\psi})} - s(\laplacian{\psi})\delta\psi + r\psi\delta\psi + u\psi^3 \delta\psi - h\delta\psi \dd{V}\\
	&= \int - s(\laplacian{\psi})\delta\psi + r\psi\delta\psi + u\psi^3 \delta\psi - h\delta\psi \dd{V}
\end{align*}
This leads to the equation
\[
-s (\laplacian{\psi}) + r\psi + u\psi^3 - h = 0
.\] 
The domain wall we seek is a solition like solution where the order parameter goes from one minimum to the other within a finite range of $x$. For $h=0$ (no external field), these minima are symmetric, and we will call them $\psi_0$. Defining the Landau free energy as
\[
f_L[\psi] = r\psi + u\psi^3
,\]
we can summarise by saying that a domain wall is a solution of the equation
\[
s\dv[2]{\psi}{x} = f_L[\psi(x)]
\]
with asymptotic boundary conditions
\[
\psi \xrightarrow{x\to\infty} = \psi_0,\qquad \psi \xrightarrow{x\to-\infty} = -\psi_0
.\] 
The free energy of said domain wall is proportional to the Ginzburg-Landau functional- defining the constant of proportionality as $A$, we find that
\begin{align*}
	F[\psi] &= A\int \frac{s}{2}(\grad{\psi})^2 + \frac{r}{2}\psi^2 + \frac{u}{4}\psi^4 \dd{V}\\
	&= A\int -\frac{s}{2}\psi\laplacian{\psi} +  \frac{r}{2}\psi^2 + \frac{u}{4}\psi^4 \dd{V}\\
	&= A\int -\frac{\psi}{2}\left( r\psi + u\psi^3 \right)+\frac{r}{2}\psi^2 + \frac{u}{4}\psi^4\dd{V}\\
	&= -A\int \frac{u}{4}\psi^4\dd{V}
\end{align*}
We need to subtract off the energy associated with a uniform configuration $\psi_0$, which is clearly given by
\[
F_0[\psi_0] = A\int \frac{r}{2}\psi_0^2 + \frac{u}{4}\psi_0^4 \dd{V}
.\] 
\end{proof}
\begin{Problem}
	Consider a two-component Dirac electron moving in one dimension through a domain wall, described by the wave equation
	\[
	\left( -i \sigma_1 \nabla_x - m(x) \sigma_3 \right) \psi = E \psi,
	\]
	where the mass field forms a domain wall, changing sign at the origin according to
	\[
	m(x) = m_0 \tanh \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{2} \xi} \right).
	\]
	Asymptotically, the energy of the excitation is gapped, with an excitation spectrum $E(k) = \sqrt{k^2 + m_0^2}$. Show that the domain wall gives rise to a zero energy bound state and derive the form of its wave function.
\end{Problem}
\begin{proof}
	Since it is given that the bound state has 0 energy, we seek such states directly:
	\[
	(-i\sigma_1\nabla_x - m(x)\sigma_3) \psi = 0
	.\] 
	This corresponds to, in matrix form, if $\psi = (\psi_1, \psi_2)^T$
	\[
	\begin{pmatrix} i\partial_x{\psi_2} + m(x)\psi_1 \\ i\partial_x{\psi_1} + m(x)\psi_2 \end{pmatrix}=0 
	.\] 
	We differentiate the first equation one more time to get
	\begin{align*}
		0 &= i\partial_x^2 \psi_2 + m(x) \partial_x \psi_1\\
		&= i\partial_x^2 \psi_2 + m(x)\left[-im(x)\psi_2  \right] 
	\end{align*}
\end{proof}
